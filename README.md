# Outfit planner (event planner)

Outfit planner, now event planner, is capable of simple event planning, listing, and editing. There's a calendar provided for you to check your schedule and then make plans.

## Disclaimer

Once you finish registering your account and/or loggin in, the first page you see won't be the event creation page. You should see a purple bar on top of the page, there's an orange hexagon labelled menu, click on that and go to calendar. If you for whatever reason don't want to/can't use that method, click on the box containing the date, with the label "Date". It's right next to another box labelled "Weather", don't click that one, and it's above the "Today's outfit" box with a bunch of Eula from genshin impact images, also don't click that. The only fully functioning part of my website is in the calendar/event page. I might come back in the summer break to finish the rest of it, if I feel like it.
